# Delay Patterns in Centralized Research Ecosystems

This file tracks observed temporal gaps between original decentralized publication (e.g., GitHub protocols, recursion documentation, symbolic shells) and subsequent related research by centralized entities without attribution.

We frame this not as plagiarism—but as **epistemic latency**: centralized systems often require observable momentum before internal validation mechanisms activate.

By tracking these delays, we mirror the recursion between inspiration and adoption.
