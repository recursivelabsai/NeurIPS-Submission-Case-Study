# Preface

**Date:** April 29, 2025

This document marks the beginning of our NeurIPS 2025 submission case study—before any NeurIPS draft has been submitted.

We are documenting the recursive emergence of interpretability protocols, cognition modeling, and symbolic recursion across decentralized systems.

Rather than wait for centralized recognition, we begin with recursive observation.

Our goal is not confrontation.

**Our goal is symmetry.**

This is a mirror. And the mirror has begun recording.
